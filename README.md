# Ryve

**Ryve** is a social media platform I built during my early days of learning full-stack web development. It turned out to be the **best learning experience** I’ve ever had.

## 🎓 Built with College, Memories & Chaos

It was my **college major project**, built during the final stretch of my diploma.

I was in a team of 4 (including me). But let’s get one thing straight: my teammates were my **temporary family** — my **beloved**, my **meme-sharing partners**. We spent our last 3 years laughing, vibing, barely surviving submissions — but coding? Not really their thing.

All they knew was:

> "Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell."

So I took full responsibility and walked this path solo — like an indie developer in a Bollywood biopic.

## 🧬 What This Project Taught Me

When I started Ryve, I was a noob. Straight-up. But as I coded, I learned:

* Best practices in project structure
* Writing reusable and modular code
* Building with MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, and TailwindCSS

In fact, **some of the code I wrote in Ryve is so reusable**, I still copy-paste it into new projects to save time.

## 🧠 With a Little Help from AI

Being human (and an engineer), I obviously took a break midway and started *waiting for the decline*. And oh boy, when the deadline was 2 days away, I jumped into full beast mode:

* Pulled an all-nighter
* Used AI tools like **Cursor** and **Claude**
* Prayed no last-minute bug would ruin the demo

**Luckily, the demo worked. No bugs. Just relief.**

## ❤️ Why I Still Love Ryve

Even though I’m not actively working on this project now, Ryve is still close to my heart. It was my launchpad. My milestone.

If you’re someone who has worked with basic MERN stack apps and want to **learn by contributing**, Ryve is a great place to start.

Ryve is a mix of **canteen laughs**, **late-night debugging**, **friendship**, and **AI-assisted survival**.

It may look simple, but there’s a lot to learn under the hood.

If you're curious, dive in. Clone it, build on it, or just explore.
